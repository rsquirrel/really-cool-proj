Usage:

1. Test compiler:
   First of all, you need to build the compiler (cd into 'src' and type 'make')
   To run all cases, type './test.bash'
   To run a single test case, type './test.bash SrcCode/xxx.tml', where 'xxx.tml' is the name of the test case.

2. Test scanner:
   1) Use Makefile and run "make scanner_test" in src to generate a scanner_test.
   2) Run "scanner_test.bash" and pass in the path of executable scanner_test as the first argument.
      If no path is specified, "../src/scanner_test" is used as default.
      This script will generate .scan file for each .tml file, recording the result of the scanner
   3) Run "scanner_test.bash clean" to remove all the .scan files.

3. Test analyzer:
   1) Use Makefile and run "make analyzer_test" in src to generate a analyzer_test.
   2) Run "analyzer_test.bash" and pass in the path of executable analyzer_test as the first argument.
      If no path is specified, "../src/analyzer_test" is used as default.
      This script will generate .sast file in directory SastOutput for each .tml file, recording the result of the analyzer
   3) Run "analyzer_test.bash clean" to remove all the .sast files.
