Usage:

1. Test compilers:
   First of all, you need to compile our codes and generate the compiler (tmlc)
   ./test.bash <path>
   The path is for the compiler.
   If no path is specified, ../src/tmlc is used as default

2. Test scanners:
   1) Use my Makefile and run "make scanner_test" in src to generate a scanner_test.
   2) Run "scanner_test.bash" and pass in the path of scanner_test as the first argument.
      If no path is specified, "../src/scanner_test" is used as default.
      This script will generate .scan file for each .tml file, recording the result of the scanner
   3) Run "scanner_test.bash clean" to remove all the .s files.
