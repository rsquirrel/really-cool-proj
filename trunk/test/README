Usage:

1. Test compilers:
   First of all, you need to build the compiler (cd into 'src' and type 'make')
   To run all cases, type './test.bash'
   To run a single test case, type './test.bash SrcCode/xxx.tml', where 'xxx.tml' is the name of the test case.

2. Test scanners:
   1) Use my Makefile and run "make scanner_test" in src to generate a scanner_test.
   2) Run "scanner_test.bash" and pass in the path of scanner_test as the first argument.
      If no path is specified, "../src/scanner_test" is used as default.
      This script will generate .scan file for each .tml file, recording the result of the scanner
   3) Run "scanner_test.bash clean" to remove all the .s files.
